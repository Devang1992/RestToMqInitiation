Outlook
Short Term (by December/January): If exploration results or project advances (e.g., pre-feasibility studies) are strong, price could move sharply upward. But if drilling stalls or capital is tight, downside is possible.

Long Term (12+ months): If the Cactus Project advances into production, ASCU could offer substantial value—though execution, copper prices, and financing are key unknowns.

📊 Summary Comparison
Ticker	Sector	Current Price	Analyst Rating	12‑Month Target Upside	Short‑Term By Jan	Long‑Term Potential
RZLV	AI / mobile commerce	~$2.75 USD	Buy	~110%	Very volatile; speculative gains possible	High risk / high reward if AI growth delivers
ASCU	Copper exploration	~C$2.39 (~US$1.75)	Strong Buy	~60–90%	Positive catalysts possible; risk of dilution or slow progress	Promising if mining project proceeds well
💡 Should You Invest $800?
If withdrawing in December/January (short-term):

RZLV could offer quick gains if sentiment or news-driven catalysts emerge—but loss potential is also high due to volatility and unproven financials.

ASCU may move on news around drilling or financing, but is similarly speculative and depends on development milestones.

If looking 1+ year out:

RZLV’s potential hinges on AI platform execution; success could lead to outsized returns.

ASCU could reward patience if the copper project transitions toward production — but requires execution and commodity tailwinds.

🚀 Recommendations
Assess your risk tolerance: Both are speculative. Only invest an amount you’re comfortable seeing fluctuate significantly.

Diversify if possible: Don’t put the full $800 into just these two. Consider splitting between higher-liquidity or established companies too.

Set a threshold/timeframe: If expecting to withdraw funds before January, monitor key updates (e.g. Rezolve placements, ASCU drilling results).

Review periodically: Check for earnings, project progress, analyst upgrades or dilution events.

✅ Bottom Line
RZLV is higher-risk, higher-reward—great if AI growth accelerates, but speculative and volatile.

ASCU offers copper exposure via early-stage exploration—with solid upside if development continues but dependent on financing and drilling success.

Investing now with intent to pull out in December/January is speculative for both—especially RZLV. If you can extend your horizon and tolerate volatility, potential rewards might outweigh risks—though there are no guarantees.

Is rhere a  way to reset kadka stream message read in code, providing offset to read from?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, in Kafka Streams you cannot directly reset the offset within the running stream using code, but there are workarounds depending on your use case.

✅ If You Want to Programmatically Control Where to Start Reading From (Code-Based Solution)
Kafka Streams doesn’t let you manually assign offsets per partition like plain Kafka consumers do. But here's what you can do:

🔁 OPTION 1: Use ConsumerConfig.auto.offset.reset = earliest or latest
This controls where to start if no committed offset exists (e.g., first run or after resetting).

props.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, "earliest"); // or "latest"
But it doesn't help if your app already has committed offsets.

🧹 OPTION 2: Use the Kafka Streams Reset Tool (External Command)
Use kafka-streams-application-reset tool provided by Kafka to reset offsets between runs.

Example:

bin/kafka-streams-application-reset \
  --application-id your-app-id \
  --bootstrap-servers localhost:9092 \
  --input-topics your-input-topic \
  --to-offset 0
Then restart your app.

You can also reset to:

--to-earliest

--to-latest

--to-datetime yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.000

More: Official Kafka Docs

🧪 OPTION 3: Use Kafka Consumer Manually in a Custom Processor
If you need precise offset control in code, you can use a regular KafkaConsumer or create a custom Processor and use context.schedule() or context.forward() manually.

But this essentially breaks out of the managed offset system Kafka Streams provides.

❗ Why Kafka Streams Doesn’t Let You Do It Easily
Kafka Streams maintains its own offset tracking and state in local RocksDB stores. This state is tied to offsets. Arbitrarily jumping offsets in the middle of processing could corrupt the stateful computations like joins, windows, etc.

🛠️ Workaround for Controlled Offset Reads (Custom App Design)
If your use case is like:

“From a controller, start consuming from offset X and stop at offset Y”

“Do not persist committed offsets so I can replay easily”

Then consider:

Use plain KafkaConsumer instead of Kafka Streams.

Manually assign partitions and seek to specific offsets:

consumer.assign(Collections.singletonList(new TopicPartition("your-topic", 0)));
consumer.seek(new TopicPartition("your-topic", 0), yourOffset);
Process messages as needed and stop.

🧠 TL;DR
Approach	Reset Type	Use Case
AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG	First run only	Default starting point
kafka-streams-application-reset	Full reset (external)	Replay from scratch
Custom KafkaConsumer	Manual control	Read from arbitrary offset
Kafka Streams API	No direct offset control	Meant for continuous processing
If you share your Kafka Streams use case (like one-off batch or file generation), I can help design the right strategy—sometimes it’s better to use KafkaConsumer for such jobs.

Let me know your exact need (e.g., read offset 5 to 100 and stop), and I can give you full code.

Kafkaitemrrader comes from which maben dependency 
ChatGPT said:
The class KafkaItemReader is part of Spring Batch Kafka integration, and it comes from the following Maven dependency:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.batch</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-infrastructure</artifactId>
</dependency>
However, KafkaItemReader specifically comes from the Spring Batch Kafka module, introduced to help integrate Kafka with Spring Batch. So you actually need:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.batch</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-infrastructure</artifactId>
</dependency>

<!-- For KafkaItemReader -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.batch</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
📦 Coordinates for KafkaItemReader (Spring Batch Kafka)
Class: org.springframework.batch.item.kafka.KafkaItemReader

Module: spring-batch-kafka

Introduced in: Spring Batch 4.2+

Make sure you use compatible versions, e.g.:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.batch</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-kafka</artifactId>
    <version>4.3.8</version> <!-- or match your Spring Boot version -->
</dependency>
You can verify it on Maven Central – spring-batch-kafka.

Let me know your Spring Boot version if you'd like the best matching versions.

How would i implement kafkareader to read from the topic as a bacth process 
ChatGPT said:
To use KafkaItemReader in a Spring Batch job to read from a Kafka topic, follow the steps below. This is perfect for one-time batch jobs that consume records from Kafka and process them (e.g., write to a file, DB, etc.).

✅ Dependencies
Make sure your pom.xml includes:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.batch</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-core</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.batch</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-kafka</artifactId>
    <version>4.3.8</version> <!-- or latest compatible -->
</dependency>
⚙️ Configuration Overview
KafkaItemReader reads records from a Kafka topic.

Batch Step uses this reader.

The job starts the step and reads all records from the topic.

You can set offsets and stop criteria.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation
1. 🧾 Kafka Consumer Config
@Bean
public Map<String, Object> consumerConfigs() {
    Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
    props.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
    props.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "batch-consumer-group");
    props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class);
    props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class);
    props.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, "earliest");
    props.put(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, false); // Required for manual commit
    return props;
}

@Bean
public ConsumerFactory<String, String> consumerFactory() {
    return new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<>(consumerConfigs());
}
2. 📘 KafkaItemReader Bean
@Bean
public KafkaItemReader<String, String> kafkaItemReader() {
    KafkaItemReader<String, String> reader = new KafkaItemReaderBuilder<String, String>()
            .partitions(0) // specify partitions, optional
            .consumerFactory(consumerFactory())
            .name("kafka-item-reader")
            .saveState(false) // Set true if you want stateful resume
            .topic("your-kafka-topic")
            .build();
    return reader;
}
3. 💡 Processor (Optional)
@Bean
public ItemProcessor<String, String> itemProcessor() {
    return item -> {
        // transform or log
        return item.toUpperCase();
    };
}
4. 📤 Writer
@Bean
public ItemWriter<String> itemWriter() {
    return items -> {
        for (String item : items) {
            System.out.println("Writing: " + item);
        }
    };
}
5. 📦 Step and Job Configuration
@Bean
public Step kafkaReaderStep(StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory) {
    return stepBuilderFactory.get("kafka-reader-step")
            .<String, String>chunk(10)
            .reader(kafkaItemReader())
            .processor(itemProcessor())
            .writer(itemWriter())
            .build();
}

@Bean
public Job kafkaBatchJob(JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory, Step kafkaReaderStep) {
    return jobBuilderFactory.get("kafka-batch-job")
            .start(kafkaReaderStep)
            .build();
}
✅ To Run the Job
You can trigger it via:

Command line argument (via JobLauncher)

REST endpoint

Scheduler

Example via controller:

@Autowired
JobLauncher jobLauncher;

@Autowired
Job kafkaBatchJob;

@GetMapping("/run-kafka-job")
public ResponseEntity<String> runJob() throws Exception {
    JobParameters jobParameters = new JobParametersBuilder()
            .addLong("startAt", System.currentTimeMillis())
            .toJobParameters();
    jobLauncher.run(kafkaBatchJob, jobParameters);
    return ResponseEntity.ok("Batch Job Started");
}
🧠 Notes
KafkaItemReader is not reactive — it reads messages until the topic has no more records to consume.

It doesn't commit offsets by default unless you manage it.

To stop after a fixed number of messages or after a time delay, you must add custom logic.

You can seek from specific offsets by customizing the underlying KafkaConsumer.

Would you like an example where:

You read messages from offset X to Y?

Or you collect and write to a file?
Let me know your use case and I can tailor it.

You said:
It doesn't commit offsets by default unless you manage it.
does that mean if you want to read from new messages only next time, will it not work?
ChatGPT said:
Great question.

By default, the KafkaItemReader does not commit offsets automatically, because it's designed for Spring Batch, which typically expects full control over execution state (like restartability, idempotency, etc.).

🔁 So What Happens Without Offset Commit?
If saveState(false) is set (which is the default in many examples), no offset is saved or committed.

When the job runs again, it will start reading from the beginning (based on the auto.offset.reset policy – usually "earliest").

That means you'll re-read old messages unless you manually commit offsets or enable state tracking.

✅ If You Want to Read Only New Messages Next Time
You have two options:

✅ Option 1: Enable State Saving and Use Job Repository
KafkaItemReader<String, String> reader = new KafkaItemReaderBuilder<String, String>()
    .consumerFactory(consumerFactory())
    .name("kafka-reader") // IMPORTANT: Name required for state persistence
    .saveState(true)       // Enables offset tracking
    .topic("your-topic")
    .build();
With this setup:

Spring Batch will persist offsets in the job execution context.

On the next run, the reader will resume from the last committed offset.

Useful for long-running jobs and restart support.

🔔 Important: You must have a proper JobRepository configured for saveState(true) to work!

✅ Option 2: Manually Commit Offsets (Advanced / DIY)
If you want more control (e.g., for reading from offset X to Y, or committing only if processing is successful), you'd use a custom KafkaConsumer instead of KafkaItemReader and do:

consumer.commitSync(); // after processing
But this is more complex and bypasses the Spring Batch abstraction.

🔁 Summary
Feature	saveState = false	saveState = true
Commits offset?	❌ No	✅ Yes (via Spring Batch context)
Resumes where left off?	❌ No (re-reads from earliest/latest)	✅ Yes
Best for	One-off batch or test jobs	Production jobs with retry/resume
Needs JobRepository configured	❌ Not required	✅ Required
✅ Recommendation for You
If you're doing a daily or periodic Kafka batch job and want to process only new messages, use:

.saveState(true)
.name("kafka-reader-job") // Unique name required
And ensure you have JobRepository properly set up (which Spring Boot does for you automatically in most cases).

Let me know if you want to add:

Custom start offset?

Filter by headers?

Or resume logic across partitions?

I can help tailor that setup.
