so I need to make system architecutre desing and sequence diagram for my spirnb batch project, how would you draw those for giffy diagrams, 

you know the crux of it

we start listening to the kafka topic via a controller call, then stop it after difined minutes, then process messages, accumulate the big file in ram and then send it to tibco mailbox and close the job

the controller call is through autosys

Gotcha—let’s design two Gliffy (Atlassian “Gliffy”, often misspelled “giffy”) diagrams you can drop into your doc: a system architecture (C4-ish container view) and a detailed sequence. I’ll give you (1) what to place and how to wire it in Gliffy and (2) copy-pasteable Mermaid code (handy for reviews; you can still recreate the same shapes in Gliffy).

System architecture (what to draw in Gliffy)
Boxes (containers/components)
Autosys (External scheduler)

HTTP Controller (Spring Boot)

label: POST /batch/start?duration=…

Job Orchestrator

inside your app; triggers/monitors Spring Batch Job

Spring Batch Job

Step 1: Ingest & Render

Kafka Consumer (manual/record-by-record)

Template/Formatter (Handlebars or your renderer)

In-Memory FileBuilder (buffered writer / paginated builder)

Step 2: Finalize & Deliver

Banner/Footer Writer

Temp .part writer (optional if you don’t want pure RAM)

SFTP Client → TIBCO Mailbox (3 attempts, backoff)

Observability (Logs + Metrics)

e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, or just Logback + file

Metadata Store (optional)

Spring Batch metadata DB (job/step executions)

Connect them (arrows, with labels)
Autosys → HTTP Controller: “invoke start (duration=MM)”

HTTP Controller → Job Orchestrator: “launch job (deadline=T0+MM)”

Job Orchestrator ↔ Spring Batch Job: “monitor + status”

Kafka → Kafka Consumer: “poll records until deadline or drain”

Kafka Consumer → Template/Formatter: “record → text blocks”

Template/Formatter → In-Memory FileBuilder: “append lines/page”

In-Memory FileBuilder → Finalize & Deliver: “assembled body”

Finalize & Deliver → TIBCO Mailbox (SFTP): “upload .txt (3 retries)”

Spring Batch Job → Metadata Store: “job/step status”

Everything → Observability: “logs/metrics”

Gliffy styling tips
Use a big “Application Boundary” container around HTTP Controller, Job Orchestrator, and Spring Batch Job.

Use cylinder shapes for Kafka and Metadata Store, cloud for TIBCO Mailbox.

Color code:

Blue = your app

Gray = external systems (Autosys, Kafka, TIBCO)

Green = observability

Sequence diagram (copy-paste ready in Mermaid)
Use this for reviews or Confluence; then reproduce the same lifelines/arrows in Gliffy.

    O->>J: start()
    J->>M: create JobExecution / StepExecution

    %% Step 1: Ingest & Render
    loop until now() >= deadline OR stopFlag OR pollEmptyN times
        J->>K: poll()
        alt record(s) received
            K-->>J: ConsumerRecords
            J->>T: map/format each record
            T-->>J: rendered line(s)
            J->>F: append(lines) + paginate
            F-->>J: ack append
        else no records
            J->>K: small backoff (e.g., 200–500ms)
        end
    end
    J->>K: commit offsets (if manual)
    J->>M: update StepExecution (ingest done)

    %% Step 2: Finalize & Deliver
    J->>F: finalizeBody() + banner/footer
    F-->>J: byte[]/stream handle
    J->>D: deliver(stream, filename)
    alt SFTP success
        D->>X: upload file
        X-->>D: success
    else transient failure
        D->>D: retry up to 3 with backoff (e.g., 5s/15s/30s)
        alt still failing
            D-->>J: throw DeliveryException
            J->>M: mark FAILED
            O-->>C: 500 + jobId
            C-->>A: failure (jobId, reason)
            return
        end
    end

    J->>M: mark COMPLETED
    O-->>C: 202 Accepted + jobId
    C-->>A: OK (jobId)
Notes to mirror in your Gliffy sequence
Lifelines (top to bottom): Autosys → HTTP Controller → Job Orchestrator → Spring Batch Job → Kafka Consumer → Template → In-Memory FileBuilder → Finalize & Deliver → Metadata DB → TIBCO.

Guards/conditions:

“loop until now() >= deadline OR stopFlag OR pollEmptyN”

SFTP retry branch with 3 attempts, exponential backoff.

Status callbacks:

Return 202 Accepted with jobId to Autosys immediately after launch (non-blocking).

Offset commit: explicit after the ingest loop (manual commit).

Extras you may want to depict (small callouts in Gliffy)
Timebox control: deadline pushed as JobParameter; worker checks it each poll.

Back-pressure: max.poll.records, fetch.min.bytes, or batching in your consumer layer.

Memory guardrails: use ByteArrayOutputStream + per-page flush; or switch to tmp .part file if size > threshold (label a “fallback to disk” note).

Idempotent delivery: final filename includes jobId + timestamp; upload to staging path then atomic rename on TIBCO if supported.

Observability: counters (records processed, pages, retries), timers (poll latency), gauges (buffer size).

One-pager description you can paste next to the diagrams
Trigger: Autosys calls POST /batch/start?duration=MM.

Orchestration: Controller launches a Spring Batch job with a deadline parameter; returns jobId immediately.

Ingest/Render: A dedicated Kafka consumer polls until the deadline. Each record is formatted (Handlebars or custom) and appended to an In-Memory FileBuilder that handles pagination, CRLF, and footer.

Finalize/Deliver: On deadline or drain, the job finalizes the file and pushes it via SFTP to the TIBCO mailbox with 3 retries (exponential backoff).

Completion: Batch metadata is updated; Autosys can poll a /batch/status/{jobId} endpoint (optional) for success/failure.

If you want, I can also generate a neat printable PDF with both diagrams, but the above should be everything you need to recreate them quickly in Gliffy.

make me the diagrams it sefl that I can copy paste, is that possible?

Yep—let’s use Mermaid so you can copy-paste directly into Confluence, GitHub, or diagrams.net (draw.io). Gliffy itself doesn’t accept a text DSL, but diagrams.net does (and Confluence has a Mermaid macro). You can still rebuild the same shapes in Gliffy if you must.

1) System Architecture (Mermaid flowchart)
Paste into a Mermaid block. In diagrams.net: Arrange → Insert → Advanced → Mermaid and paste.
