STEP 1 — Create a directory for readable output

Inside the container:

mkdir -p /var/mqm/trace_readable

🔥 STEP 2 — Convert EVERY .TRC file to readable format

Run this inside the container:

for f in /var/mqm/trace/*.TRC; do
    base=$(basename "$f" .TRC)
    dmpmqtrc -f "$f" > "/var/mqm/trace_readable/${base}.txt"
done


What this does:

Loops through all .TRC files

Converts each using dmpmqtrc

Saves a readable .txt version in /var/mqm/trace_readable

🔥 STEP 3 — Combine all readable logs into ONE BIG FILE

Run:

cat /var/mqm/trace_readable/*.txt > /var/mqm/trace_readable/ALL_TRACE_READABLE.txt


Now you have:

/var/mqm/trace_readable/ALL_TRACE_READABLE.txt


This is the full readable trace — everything MQ did.

🔥 STEP 4 — (Optional) Copy the big file to your host

If you want it on your host machine:

docker cp <container-id>:/var/mqm/trace_readable/ALL_TRACE_READABLE.txt ./ALL_TRACE_READABLE.txt

🔍 Useful Searches in the Readable File

Once you have the combined readable file:

Find all MQGET calls:
grep -n "MQGET" ALL_TRACE_READABLE.txt

Find all timeouts:
grep -n "MQRC_NO_MSG_AVAILABLE" ALL_TRACE_READABLE.txt

Find WaitInterval used:
grep -n "WaitInterval" ALL_TRACE_READABLE.txt

Count MQGET calls:
grep -R "MQGET" ALL_TRACE_READABLE.txt | wc -l

⭐ Your Counts So Far

You said:

MQGET = 10

NO_MSG_AVAILABLE = 6

This PERFECTLY matches IBM MQ expected behavior:

MQGET was called 10 times

6 times there was no message

The other 4 returned messages or ended differently

If you want, upload the combined file

If you upload:

ALL_TRACE_READABLE.txt


I will:

Parse out every MQGET

Show exact frequency (GET/sec)

Show WaitInterval MQ is using

Build a summary you can give to your MQ team

Just run the commands above and share the readable file.
