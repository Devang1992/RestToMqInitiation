here’s a clean, beginner-friendly tour of Spring Batch—what each piece is, how they work together, and what changed in the latest Spring Batch 5 / Spring Boot 3 world.

1) Big picture

Spring Batch runs jobs.
A job is made of one or more steps.
Each step either:

uses the chunk-oriented style: ItemReader → ItemProcessor → ItemWriter, or

uses a Tasklet (a single block of code you run once per step).

Jobs and steps store their state and metrics (read count, write count, exit code…) in a JobRepository so you can restart, monitor, and audit.

2) Job-level building blocks
Job

A container for steps.

Has a name, optional parameters (e.g., fileDate=2025-08-20), and a flow (step1 → step2 …).

You build it with JobBuilder, e.g. .start(step1).next(step2).build().

JobParameters

Immutable key–value pairs for a run.

Used to make each execution unique and to pass runtime inputs.

Common trick: add a "run.id" (timestamp) so each launch is unique.

JobRepository

Persists run state (job instances, executions, step executions, counters).

Backed by a database (H2, Postgres, etc.). Spring Boot can auto-create schema.

JobLauncher

Starts a job with given parameters.

Can be synchronous (default) or asynchronous (when backed by a TaskExecutor).

JobExplorer / JobOperator

JobExplorer: read-only view of job metadata (find executions, get status).

JobOperator: higher-level control (start, stop, restart, abandon) by name/ID.

3) The chunk-oriented step (Reader → Processor → Writer)
What is a “chunk”?

A transaction boundary that groups items.

Loop: read N items → process N items → write N items → commit.

If something fails in this chunk, the framework can retry/skip, then continue.

ItemReader

Produces one item at a time (or null to signal “no more data”).

Examples: FlatFileItemReader, JdbcCursorItemReader, KafkaItemReader, custom readers.

Step-scoped readers (@StepScope) can read job parameters at runtime.

ItemProcessor (optional)

Transforms, filters, or validates a single item.

Return null to filter an item (it won’t be written and increments “filtered”).

Keep it stateless if you can.

ItemWriter

Called with a List of items (the chunk) to write in one go.

Examples: FlatFileItemWriter, JdbcBatchItemWriter, custom ItemWriter<T>.

Writers should be idempotent if possible—important for restarts.

ItemStream (optional interface)

Readers/Writers can implement ItemStream to get open/update/close lifecycle hooks and store internal state in the ExecutionContext (for restartability).

Fault tolerance (optional)

You can configure .faultTolerant(), .skip(), .retry(), .noRollback() on the step.

Spring Batch will retry or skip failed items within a chunk, then commit.

4) The Tasklet-style step
What’s a Tasklet?

A single unit of work interface: RepeatStatus execute(StepContribution, ChunkContext).

You write your own logic (open a socket, call an API, move/rename files, run a script).

Return RepeatStatus.FINISHED to stop; return RepeatStatus.CONTINUABLE to loop.

When to use Tasklet vs Chunk?

Tasklet: best for one-shot work—file rename, S3 move, aggregate post-processing, cleanup.

Chunk: best for streaming lots of records—read/process/write many items with transactions, retries, skips.

It’s common to mix them in a job (e.g., step1 chunk from Kafka → file; step2 tasklet rename file).

5) Execution context & restartability
ExecutionContext

A small key–value map persisted by the framework for job and step scopes.

Use it to save progress (e.g., last processed offset, output file name), so a crash can restart where you left off.

Skip, Retry, Rollback

Configure on the step. Example: retry network blips up to 3 times; skip malformed lines up to 100; fail the job if over the skip limit.

6) Parallelism & scaling (when you need it)

TaskExecutor on a step: multi-threaded chunk processing (concurrency).

Partitioning: split a step into partitions (e.g., by file range/partition id) processed in parallel.

Remote chunking and remote partitioning: distribute work across JVMs via messaging.

7) Observability

Listeners: JobExecutionListener, StepExecutionListener, ItemRead/Process/WriteListeners for logging/metrics.

Counters you’ll care about:

readCount, writeCount, filterCount, skipCount, commitCount, rollbackCount, exit status.

Expose metrics via Spring Boot Actuator if you like.

8) Spring Batch 5 / Spring Boot 3 changes (important)

@EnableBatchProcessing is no longer recommended in Boot apps.

Boot’s auto-configuration now wires JobRepository, JobLauncher, etc.

If you need custom wiring, extend DefaultBatchConfiguration or define beans yourself.

Default Boot runner tries to run jobs at startup. To avoid this for REST-driven launches:

spring.batch.job.enabled=false

Transaction & repository:

Batch now expects a PlatformTransactionManager with the repository.

Many older APIs were deprecated/removed; prefer the builders (JobBuilder, StepBuilder, item reader/writer builders) and the new jakarta.* packages.

If you see bean name collisions for jobLauncher/jobOperator, rename your custom beans (e.g., asyncJobLauncher) so Boot’s defaults can coexist.

9) How the flow feels at runtime (chunk step)

JobLauncher starts the job with parameters.

Step begins a transaction.

Reader returns items one by one until it has chunkSize items or runs out.

Processor transforms each item (nulls are filtered).

Writer writes the list of transformed items.

Transaction commits; counters update in JobRepository.

Repeat 2–6 until Reader.read() returns null.

Step finishes; job moves to the next step or completes.

10) Where Kafka fits

Use KafkaItemReader<K,V> in a chunk step to read from Kafka.

Processor converts the value (or key+value) to your target format.

Writer appends to a file (or writes to DB, S3, etc.).

If you also need a final rename or banner injection, add a Tasklet step at the end.

11) Practical tips (the stuff that saves you time)

Mark readers/writers/processors as @StepScope when they need job parameters.

Use a staging file (e.g., *.part) while writing; rename at the end in a tasklet to avoid incomplete pickups.

Keep processors stateless; put mutable state in ExecutionContext if needed.

For async REST starts, create a custom-named JobLauncher with a TaskExecutor and use it in your controller; return 202 Accepted with a status URL.

Validate configuration early: topic exists, directories exist, chunk size > 0, etc.

TL;DR

Chunk step (Reader → Processor → Writer) is for high-volume record processing with transactions, retries, and restarts.

Tasklet step is for one-shot, imperative tasks (rename/move/cleanup).

Spring Batch 5 + Boot 3: rely on auto-config, avoid @EnableBatchProcessing, and disable auto-job-run if you start via REST.
