In a Spring Boot application, logs can be categorized into different types based on their purpose and the kind of information they capture. Two common types of logs are audit logs and application logs.

Application Logs
Application logs are general-purpose logs that capture the operational details and behavior of the application. They are primarily used for:

Debugging: Identifying and fixing issues in the application.
Monitoring: Observing the application's performance and behavior over time.
Error Tracking: Logging errors and exceptions that occur during application execution.
Typical Information in Application Logs
Startup and Shutdown Messages: Information about the application starting and stopping.
Service Calls: Information about calls to different services within the application.
Debugging Information: Detailed information useful for debugging issues.
Warnings and Errors: Messages indicating potential or actual issues in the application.
Example
log
Copy code
2024-06-25 10:00:00 INFO  com.example.MyService - Starting service
2024-06-25 10:00:01 DEBUG com.example.MyService - Processing data: {...}
2024-06-25 10:00:02 WARN  com.example.MyService - Missing optional configuration
2024-06-25 10:00:03 ERROR com.example.MyService - Error processing data: {...}
Audit Logs
Audit logs, on the other hand, are specialized logs that capture security-related events and changes within the application. They are primarily used for:

Security: Tracking access to sensitive information and operations.
Compliance: Ensuring the application meets regulatory and compliance requirements.
Accountability: Keeping a record of actions taken by users and administrators for accountability.
Typical Information in Audit Logs
User Authentication Events: Logins, logouts, and failed login attempts.
Authorization Events: Access to restricted resources or actions.
Data Changes: Changes to important data or configuration.
Administrative Actions: Actions taken by administrators, such as user management or configuration changes.
Example
log
Copy code
2024-06-25 10:00:00 INFO  AuditLogger - User 'john.doe' logged in from IP 192.168.1.1
2024-06-25 10:05:00 INFO  AuditLogger - User 'john.doe' accessed 'confidentialReport'
2024-06-25 10:10:00 INFO  AuditLogger - User 'admin' changed configuration: {...}
2024-06-25 10:15:00 WARN  AuditLogger - Failed login attempt for user 'unknown.user'
How to Implement in Spring Boot
Application Logs
Spring Boot uses SLF4J with Logback by default for logging. You can configure application logging in application.properties or application.yml.

Example: application.properties

properties
Copy code
logging.level.root=INFO
logging.level.com.example=DEBUG
logging.file.name=app.log
Audit Logs
You can implement audit logging by using Spring's @EventListener to listen for specific events or by manually logging audit events in your service methods.

Example: Using Spring Events

java
Copy code
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class AuditLogger {

    @EventListener
    public void handleUserLoginEvent(UserLoginEvent event) {
        // Log the audit information
        System.out.println("User " + event.getUsername() + " logged in at " + event.getTimestamp());
    }

    // Other event handlers for different audit events
}
Example: Manually Logging Audit Events

java
Copy code
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {
    private static final Logger auditLogger = LoggerFactory.getLogger("AuditLogger");

    public void performSensitiveAction(String username) {
        // Log the audit information
        auditLogger.info("User " + username + " performed a sensitive action");

        // Perform the action
    }
}
Configuration: logback-spring.xml

xml
Copy code
<configuration>
    <!-- Application logs configuration -->
    <appender name="APP_LOG" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <file>app.log</file>
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <!-- Audit logs configuration -->
    <appender name="AUDIT_LOG" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <file>audit.log</file>
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <logger name="AuditLogger" level="INFO" additivity="false">
        <appender-ref ref="AUDIT_LOG" />
    </logger>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="APP_LOG" />
    </root>
</configuration>
By separating application and audit logs, you can ensure that operational and security-related events are logged appropriately and can be easily monitored and audited.
